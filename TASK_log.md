### 2024-07-31 12:00:00 - Fix Retry Mechanism in `geminiAnalysis.worker.ts` - âœ… COMPLETED
**Task:** Correct the bug in the `analyzeWithPrompt` function where the `shouldRetry` function was passing a hardcoded `attemptNumber` of `1` to `shouldRetryLLMCall`. This prevents the retry logic from working correctly.

**Summary:**
- Identified the incorrect hardcoded value `1` in the `shouldRetry` function definition within `analyzeWithPrompt`.
- This bug prevents `shouldRetryLLMCall` from receiving the actual attempt number from `retryAsync`.
- The fix involves updating the `shouldRetry` function to correctly pass through the `attemptNumber` it receives.
- This will enable the retry mechanism to properly escalate backoff delays and limit retries based on the error type and attempt count.
