# Memory Bank - CortexReel Standalone

This Memory Bank system provides comprehensive documentation and context for the **cortex-reel-standalone** project - a professional React TypeScript screenplay analysis platform designed for film industry professionals.

## üìñ Purpose

The AI assistant's memory resets completely between sessions. This Memory Bank serves as the **only source of truth** for understanding project context, architecture decisions, current status, and development patterns. Every AI session MUST begin by reading all Memory Bank files to ensure continuity and effective assistance.

## üéØ Project Overview

**CortexReel Standalone** is a React TypeScript Single Page Application that enables film industry professionals to upload PDF screenplays and receive comprehensive AI-powered analysis across 27 different analytical dimensions with complete administrative control.

### Key Features
- **üéØ Complete Admin Dashboard**: Three-tab configuration interface with full integration to analysis pipeline
- **üöÄ MEGA PROMPT v7.0**: "MISTYCZNY ALTER EGO RE≈ªYSERA" - 27-section comprehensive film analysis  
- **‚ö° Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Upgraded AI model with 65,536 token output capacity
- **üìÑ PDF Processing**: Direct text extraction + OCR fallback with progress tracking
- **üé® Professional Visualizations**: Role-based dashboards and interactive charts
- **üé¨ Film Industry Focus**: Polish film industry standards and terminology
- **ü§ñ Automated Testing**: MCP Playwright testing suite for quality assurance

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Material-UI + Zustand
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro API
- **Visualization**: Recharts library
- **Build Tool**: Vite with optimized production builds
- **File Processing**: PDF.js + Tesseract.js (OCR fallback)

## üö® Critical Information

### Security Concerns
- **API Key Exposure**: Gemini API key currently exposed in client bundle (HIGH PRIORITY FIX NEEDED)
- **Client-Side Processing**: All processing happens in browser (scalability limitation)

### Architecture Decisions
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend currently implemented
- **Local Storage**: State persistence using Zustand + localStorage
- **Web Workers**: Background processing for heavy operations
- **Role-Based UI**: Dynamic content filtering based on user role

### Performance Characteristics
- **Initial Load**: <3 seconds target
- **Analysis Time**: 2-5 minutes average for complete 27-section analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Stable for normal sessions (<500MB)
- **Bundle Size**: ~2.5MB gzipped

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Context

### Current Status (2025-01-16)
- **‚úÖ ADMIN DASHBOARD ‚Üí ANALYSIS PIPELINE INTEGRATION**: FULLY COMPLETED and verified
- **‚úÖ GEMINI 2.5 FLASH + MEGA PROMPT v7.0**: Comprehensive 27-section analysis implemented
- **‚úÖ MCP PLAYWRIGHT TESTING**: Complete automated testing suite confirming functionality
- **‚úÖ API KEY INTEGRATION**: Resolved - previous "integration gap" was missing API key, not code issue
- **Visualization System**: Complete redesign with 10 major components functional

### Known Issues Being Tracked
1. **‚úÖ RESOLVED: Configuration Integration** - Was falsely reported, actually working correctly
2. Large file processing performance (PDFs >5MB) - Enhancement opportunity
3. LocalStorage size limits for large analysis results - Monitoring
4. API key security risk - High priority for backend implementation

### Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, 95%+ coverage
- **Component Design**: Atomic Design pattern
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation required
- **Performance**: Optimized for film industry workflows
- **UI/UX**: Professional appearance, dark mode primary

## üìã Usage Protocol

### For AI Assistants

1. **ALWAYS** start each session by reading ALL Memory Bank files
2. **UNDERSTAND** current project state from `activeContext.md`
3. **REVIEW** implementation status in `progress.md`
4. **FOLLOW** established patterns documented in `systemPatterns.md`
5. **MAINTAIN** consistency with technical decisions in `techContext.md`

### For Developers

1. **READ** this README first for project overview
2. **STUDY** `systemPatterns.md` for architectural understanding
3. **CHECK** `activeContext.md` for current work context
4. **REFERENCE** `techContext.md` for setup and configuration
5. **UPDATE** Memory Bank when making significant changes

## üîÑ Update Protocol

### When to Update Memory Bank

- New architectural patterns discovered
- Significant feature implementations completed
- Major bug fixes or performance improvements
